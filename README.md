<p>Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. In 2020, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 685 000 deaths globally.  It occurs when breast cells mutate and grow out of control, creating a mass of tissue. Breast cancer can invade and grow into the tissue surrounding the breast. In this project, I have developed a custom deep neural network that has been trained on infected and uninfected breast cancer histopathological images and is able to identify whether a person has breast cancer or not with 90% accuracy. </p>
